        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="info">
        <p>I am an experienced maths teacher from Ukraine. Mathematics was my favourite subject in school, and I decided to continue studying it at university. 
          After graduation, I taught students mathematical analysis, algebra, probability, and differential equations, while simultaneously, working on my PhD thesis in mathematical analysis. </p>
         <p> After my first child was born, my husband and I decided to move to the UK. When my son started school, I was determined to continue my teaching career in the UK. 
          To achieve this, I had to complete GCSE English as well as pass all entry exams for the teaching profession. While I was studying in a local college, I also started volunteering. 
          I helped in a school as well as in a library, assisting seniors to learn basic computer skills. </p>
         <p>In September 2016, I started postgraduate studies at Kingâ€™s College London. It was a very intense year with many challenges and achievements: 
          teaching in two schools, authoring essays and collecting evidence for the teaching standards. 
          After completing the PGCE program, I was offered a job at Brentwood Ursuline High School for Girls where I worked for a year before taking parental leave. </p> 
         <p> During the pandemic and while on childcare leave, I decided to try something different in terms of my career. 
          I started with basic online Python courses on Coursera which I found interesting and motivating. 
          I felt a sense of satisfaction and fulfilment from completing challenging coding tasks, and so 
          I decided to continue learning to programme and make it my future profession.
          I went on to complete the EPAM Python Online UA course and then the TechSwitch retraining program. 
          While studying in the TechSwitch Coding Bootcamp I learnt JavaScript, React, C#, HTML and CSS. 
          Currently, I am mastering Typescript, React and SQL while working on my personal projects.  </p>
          <p>As you can see from the above, I enjoy learning and have been learning all my life. 
          I want to continue to grasp new skills and ideas. 
          I want to help other people through developing software, and I would like to have a creative, challenging, and flexible job which offers career development. 
          In a fast-expanding industry such as software development, it is more than achievable. 
          I am full of enthusiasm and ready for the challenges of this new career. </p>
